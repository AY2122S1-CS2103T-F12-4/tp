## Introduction

Welcome to ezFoodieâ€™s User Guide! ðŸ¤©

Have you faced some issues when managing the members in your restaurant? ezFoodie is here!

ezFoodie is a desktop application that helps restaurants **keep track of their ever-growing list of members**. Restaurant managers and staffs can easily view and update member status (e.g. personal information, tier, reservation, transaction, etc.) to manage and analyze members.

ezFoodie is simple and user-friendly. It is optimized for using via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ezFoodie can get your member management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

**Looks cool and interested?** ðŸ¤© Continue reading on to explore the wonders of ezFoodie and enhance the way you manage and analyze your members.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ezFoodie.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ezFoodie.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list -m`** : Lists out a certain number of members, show top 50 records by default.

   * **`add -m`**`-n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johndoe@gmail.com` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the member list.

   * **`del -m`**`-id 3` : Deletes the member with member ID 3 shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Clears the program.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the program.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find -m -n <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `find -m -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `list -m [-pg <PAGE>]` can be used as `list -m -pg 1` or as `list -m`.

* The `list` and `find` are only show top 50 records by default, can use pagination `[-pg <PAGE>]` as optional value to choose different pages.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-p 12341234 -p 56785678`, only `-p 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Meanings of shortcuts:

  * `-m`: member

  * `-n`: name

  * `-p`: phone

  * `-e`: email

  * `-t`: transaction

  * `-d`: date

  * `-b`: bill amount

  * `-pg`: page
