## Introduction

Welcome to ezFoodieâ€™s User Guide! ðŸ¤©

Have you faced some issues when managing the members in your restaurant? ezFoodie is here!

ezFoodie is a desktop application that helps restaurants **keep track of their ever-growing list of members**. Restaurant managers and staffs can easily view and update member status (e.g. personal information, tier, reservation, transaction, etc.) to manage and analyze members.

ezFoodie is simple and user-friendly. It is optimized for using via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ezFoodie can get your member management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

**Looks cool and interested?** ðŸ¤© Continue reading on to explore the wonders of ezFoodie and enhance the way you manage and analyze your members.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find -mem -n <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `find -mem -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `list -mem [-pg <PAGE>]` can be used as `list -mem -pg 1` or as `list -mem`.

* The `list` and `find` are only show top 50 records by default, can use pagination `[-pg <PAGE>]` as optional value to choose different pages.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-p 12341234 -p 56785678`, only `-p 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Meanings of shortcuts:

  * `-id`: member ID or transaction ID

  * `-row`: index number of the membet list

  * `-mem`: member
  
  * `-f`: redeem

  * `-n`: name
