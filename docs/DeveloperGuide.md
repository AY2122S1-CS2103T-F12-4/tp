### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EzFoodieParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![ParserClasses](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EzFoodieParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EzFoodieParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the ezFoodie data i.e., all `Member` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMemberList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Member` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EzFoodieStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

`[written by: Hu Jiajun]`

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `find -m -id 10001 10002` command to find the members with the member ids `10001` and `10002` in the application.

2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes this command to the `EzFoodieParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

3. The `EzFoodieParser` detects the command word `find` in the string and extracts the argument string `-m -id 10001 10002`.

4. The `EzFoodieParser` creates a new `FindCommandParser` instance to parse the argument string according to the format specified for `FindCommand`.

5. The argument string is parsed to the member ids array `[10001, 10002]` using the `FindCommandParser#parse(String)` method, which also performs validation.

6. The `FindCommandParser` creates a new `IdContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance with the member ids array `[10001, 10002]` to handle the filter.

7. The `FindCommandParser` creates a new `FindCommand` instance with the `IdContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance and returns it to `EzFoodieParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

8. The `LogicManager` calls the `FindCommand#execute(Model)` method.

9. The `FindCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredMemberList(IdContainsKeywordsPredicate)` method.

10. The `Model` calls the `FilteredList#setPredicate(IdContainsKeywordsPredicate)` to filter the members by the member ids `10001` and `10002`

11. The application lists the filtered members.

12. Lastly, the `FindCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a `SuccessMessage` and returns it to `LogicManager`.

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

**Sequence diagram showcasing the find command process**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser`, `IdContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command to find the members by keywords:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

**Activity diagram showcasing the find command execution flow**

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to execute different types of keywords with `FindCommand`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add corresponding constructors for different types of keywords.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, only need to make a few changes to the source code.
  * Cons: Insufficient use of object-oriented features (inheritance and polymorphic).

* **Alternative 2:** Abstract `FindCommand`, create different classes according to different types of keywords to inherit `FindCommand`, such as `FindIdCommand`, `FindNameCommand`, `FindEmailCommand`, etc.
  * Pros: Sufficient use of object-oriented features (inheritance and polymorphic).
  * Cons: Have to make more changes to the source code, it may cause potential bugs.

### Sort feature

`[written by: Hu Jiajun]`

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `sort -m -c -a` command to sort the members by their credits in ascending order in the application.

2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes this command to the `EzFoodieParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

3. The `EzFoodieParser` detects the command word `sort` in the string and extracts the argument string `-m -c -a`.

4. The `EzFoodieParser` creates a new `SortCommandParser` instance to parse the argument string according to the format specified for `SortCommand`.

5. The argument string is parsed to `a` (ascending order) and converted to the enum tpye `SortStatus.ASC` using the `SortCommandParser#parse(String)` method, which also performs validation.

6. The `SortCommandParser` creates a new `CreditSortComparator` instance with the enum tpye `SortStatus.ASC` to handle the sort.

7. The `SortCommandParser` creates a new `SortCommand` instance with the `CreditSortComparator` instance and returns it to `EzFoodieParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

8. The `LogicManager` calls the `SortCommand#execute(Model)` method.

9. The `SortCommand` calls the `Model#updateSortedMemberList(CreditSortComparator)` method.

10. The `Model` calls the `SortedList#setComparator(CreditSortComparator)` method to sort the members by their credits in ascending order

11. The application lists the sorted members.

12. Lastly, the `SortCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a `SuccessMessage` and returns it to `LogicManager`.

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

**Sequence diagram showcasing the sort command process**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser`, `CreditSortComparator` and `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command to sort the members by their credits:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

**Activity diagram showcasing the sort command execution flow**

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to sort by different types of fields with `SortCommand`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add corresponding constructors for different types of fields.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, only need to make a few changes to the source code.
  * Cons: Insufficient use of object-oriented features (inheritance and polymorphic).

* **Alternative 2:** Abstract `SortCommand`, create different classes according to different types of fields to inherit `SortCommand`, such as `SortPointCommand`, `SortCreditCommand`, etc.
  * Pros: Sufficient use of object-oriented features (inheritance and polymorphic).
  * Cons: Have to make more changes to the source code, it may cause potential bugs.

### Add member feature

`[written by: Zhang Zhiyao]`

1. when user add transaction , it will auto-trigger update new credit

#### Design consideration

### Update Point feature

`[written by: Zhang Zhiyao]`

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update point feature behaves at each step.

1. when user add transaction, it will auto update new point

2. The user executes `redeem -r -id` command to redeem point from exist credit by user id.

3. The user executes `redeem -r -index` command to redeem point from exist credit by user index listed in page.

#### Design consideration

### Add Reservation Feature

`[written by: Raja Sudalaimuthu Mukund]`

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add reservation mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `add -rs/ -dt/2021-01-01 00:00 -rm/2 people -id/10001` command to add a reservation for 2 people at
    2021-01-01 00:00 hrs to member id 10001's reservation list.

2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes this command to the 
    `EzFoodieParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

3. The EzFoodieParser detects the command word `add` in the string and extracts the argument string 
    `-rs/ -dt/2021-01-01 00:00 -rm/2 people -id/10001`.

4. The EzFoodieParser creates a new `AddCommandPrefixParser` instance to parse the argument string according to the 
    format specified for `AddCommand` and calls `AddCommandPrefixParser#parse(arguments)`.

5. `AddCommandPrefixParser#parse(arguments)` detects the prefix `-rs/` and creates a new instance of 
    `AddReservationCommandParser` and calls `AddReservationCommandParser#parse(arguments)`.

6. `AddReservationCommandParser#parse(arguments)` detects the prefixes `-dt/`, `-rm/` and `-id/` and parses them through 
    `ParseUtil` to obtain the `dateTime`, `remark` and the `memberID`.

7. Using the obtained `dateTime` and `remark`, a new instance of `Reservation` is created.

8. Using the new instance of `Reservation` and the obtained `memberID`, a new instance of `AddReservationCommand` is created and returned to 
    ezFoodieParser which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

9. `LogicManager` calls the `AddReservationCommand#execute(Model)` method.

10. The `AddReservationCommand` calls `Model#getUpdatedMemberList()` and searches the list to find the member with the respective
    `memberID` to obtain `memberToEdit`.

11. The `AddReservationCommand` calls `Model#createUpdatedReservations(memberToEdit, reservationToAdd)` to create a new 
    instance of the same member but with the new reservation added to the member's reservation list.

12. The `AddReservationCommand` calls `Model#setMember(memberToEdit, editedMember)` to replace the old instance of the member
    with its new instance.

13. The `AddReservationCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredMemberList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEMBERS)` to update the current
    member list with the updated member list.

14. The application lists the updated member list.

15. Lastly, `AddReservationCommand` creates a new instance of `CommandResult` with a success message, and returns it to Logic Manager.

![AddReservationSequenceDiagram](images/AddReservationSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration

### Delete Reservation Feature

`[written by: Chen Shi Yao, Stephanie]`

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete reservation mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `del -rs/ -id/10001100001` command to delete the reservation with reservationId 100001 for the
    member with ID 10001.

2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes this command to the
   `EzFoodieParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

3. The EzFoodieParser detects the command word `del` in the string and extracts the argument string
   `-rs/ -id/10001100001`.

4. The EzFoodieParser creates a new `DeleteCommandPrefixParser` instance to parse the argument string according to the
   format specified for `DeleteCommand` and calls `DeleteCommandPrefixParser#parse(arguments)`.

5. `DeleteCommandPrefixParser#parse(arguments)` detects the prefix `-rs/` and creates a new instance of
   `DeleteReservationCommandParser` and calls `DeleteReservationCommandParser#parse(arguments)`.

6. `DeleteReservationCommandParser#parse(arguments)` detects the prefixes `-id/` and parses them through
   `ParseUtil` to obtain the `memberId` and `ReservationId`.

7. Using the obtained `memberID` and `ReservationId`, a new instance of `DeleteReservationCommand` is created and returned to
   ezFoodieParser which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`. 

8. `LogicManager` calls the `DeleteReservationCommand#execute(Model)` method.

9. The `DeleteReservationCommand` calls `Model#getUpdatedMemberList()` and searches the list to find the member with the respective
    `memberID` to obtain `memberToEdit`.
   
10. Using the `reservationId`, the `DeleteReservationCommand` then searches the list of `Reservations` associated with the 
    `memberToEdit` to find the `reservationToDelete`.

11. The `DeleteReservationCommand` calls `DeleteReservationCommand#createEditedMember(memberToEdit, reservationToDelete)` to create a new
    instance of the same member but with the reservation deleted from the member's reservation list.

12. The `DeleteReservationCommand` calls `Model#setMember(memberToEdit, editedMember)` to replace the old instance of the member
    with its new instance.

13. The `DeleteReservationCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredMemberList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEMBERS)` to update the current
    member list with the updated member list.

14. The application lists the updated member list.

15. Lastly, `DeleteReservationCommand` creates a new instance of `CommandResult` with a success message, and returns it to Logic Manager.

![DeleteReservationSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteReservationSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile story**:

Ben is a restaurant manager. He found that restaurants are becoming more and more popular, the number of members is increasing, and there are a large number of reservations every day. Every day the front desk staffs spend a lot of time in excel or on paper to record new members, record reservations and transactions, and find reservations. With the need to handle multiple tasks at the same time, the staffs are also prone to make careless mistakes at work due to fatigue. ðŸ˜ž

More importantly, the member list is only stored in excel, it makes it difficult for Ben to manage and analyze members to formulate targeted promotional strategies, which will have bad impact on the profit expansion of the restaurant. ðŸ˜ž

As a manager who is proficient in technology and has commendable experience in Unix, Ben hopes to develop an easy-to-operate application to improve the work efficiency of himself and the staffs. ðŸ¤©

**Target user profile summary**:

Managers and staffs who

* work in highly popular restaurants whose number of members is increasing
* are responsible for managing a large number of member registrations, transactions and reservations daily
* are required to multi-task (manage member registrations and reservations)
* need to manage and analyze members to formulate promotional strategies
* are proficient in technology
* want to get things done quickly
* are tired of tracking member details from paper or excel
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing to using mouse
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

helps restaurants keep track of their ever-growing list of members. Restaurant managers and staffs can easily view and update member status (e.g. personal information, tier, reservation, transaction, etc.) to manage and analyze members based on various criteria faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application.
