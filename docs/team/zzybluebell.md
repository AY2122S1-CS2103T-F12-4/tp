### Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project ezFoodie under NUS module CS2103T in AY21/22 semester 1.

### Project: ezFoodie

ezFoodie is a desktop application that helps restaurants **keep track of their ever-growing list of members**.
Restaurant managers and staffs can easily view and update member status (e.g. personal information, tier, reservation, transaction, etc.) to manage and analyze members.
Restaurant managers and staffs interact with ezFoodie using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

It is written in Java, and has about 35 kLoC, of which I contributed about 10 kLoC.
